# Heat-Control-Box
Arduino code to control multiple sensors and write data to an SD card.

Hardware used...
  - BMP180 Barometric Pressure gage
  - Basic SD card module
  - 5V heat pad (lots of them out there)
  - Analog temperature gage (i.e. TMP36)

The objective was to create a box where we monitored heat and kept it within a certain range.
We also wanted to monitor the pressure inside the box. 
The purpose being to ensure plants inside had good growing conditions during the ballon flight.
